# BedrockHitboxMod
A hitbox modification for Minecraft Windows 10 Edition.

## How do i use it?
You open the project via visual studio, and build the entire project, the entry point is located at: `BedrockHitboxMod/BedrockHitboxMod/Main.cpp` <br>
Once the program has been compiled, you simply run the .exe and use the (really bad) TUI to configure your hitbox size.
